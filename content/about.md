### Short Bio

I am currently an Associate Research Scientist and leader of the [Galactic Dynamics
group](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/dynamics/)
at the [Center for Computational
Astrophysics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/)
(CCA) at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/) in New
York City.

I am also the Assistant Director of Scientific Software at the [Simons
Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/).

I received my PhD in 2016 with advisor [Kathryn V.
Johnston](http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~kvj/) in the Department of Astronomy at
Columbia University. I was then a Lyman Spitzer, Jr. Postdoctoral Fellow in the
Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University. I was a Flatiron Research
Fellow at the CCA from 2019 to 2021.


### Software

I am a member of the [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) Coordination Committee, a core
contributor to Astropy, and a maintainer of the `astropy.coordinates` and
`astropy.units` subpackages.

Some other, more specialized Python packages I have written:

- [**Gala**](https://github.com/adrn/gala): For Galactic and gravitational dynamics.
- [**pyia**](https://github.com/adrn/pyia): For working with data from the Gaia Mission.
- [**schwimmbad**](https://github.com/adrn/schwimmbad): Provides a uniform interface to
  parallel processing pools and enables switching easily between local development
  (e.g., with multiprocessing) and deployment on a cluster or supercomputer (via, e.g.,
  MPI or JobLib).
- [**The Joker**](https://github.com/adrn/thejoker): A custom Monte Carlo sampler for
  the two-body problem.

All of my other projects and code is available in various repositories on my GitHub
profile [@adrn](https://github.com/adrn).
