My research ranges from mapping dark matter in the Milky Way, to the formation and
evolution of our Galaxy, to characterizing stellar and binary star populations. I have
spent a lot of time thinking about surveys of Milky Way stars and how to use these data
to infer its structure and dynamical history. I am particularly excited about the
[*Gaia* mission](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia) and am a co-organizer of the [Gaia
sprints](https://gaia.lol/).
